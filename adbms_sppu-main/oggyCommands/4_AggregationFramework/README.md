4. Implement Map-reduce and aggregation, indexing with suitable example in MongoDB. Demonstrate the following:
 (i) Aggregation framework

What is MapReduce in MongoDB?
Answer: MapReduce is a data processing technique in MongoDB that processes large amounts of data through two phases: the map phase, where data is processed and emitted as key-value pairs, and the reduce phase, where values for each key are aggregated.

What is the purpose of the aggregate function in MongoDB?
Answer: The aggregate function in MongoDB is used to process and transform data in the database through a pipeline of stages, such as grouping, filtering, sorting, and projecting. It allows for advanced data analysis and aggregation.

What does the $group stage in MongoDB aggregation do?
Answer: The $group stage groups documents by a specified identifier (like a field) and performs aggregation operations (such as summing or averaging) on other fields.

What is an index in MongoDB and why is it important?
Answer: An index in MongoDB improves the speed of data retrieval operations by allowing the database to quickly locate documents matching a query. It is important because it helps reduce query execution time, especially in large collections.

Explain the $sum and $avg operators used in MongoDB aggregation.
Answer:

$sum: Calculates the total sum of a given field across all documents in the group.
$avg: Calculates the average value of a given field across all documents in the group.
What is the significance of the emit function in MongoDB MapReduce?
Answer: The emit function in MongoDB's MapReduce operation is used in the map phase to emit key-value pairs. These pairs are then processed by the reduce phase to aggregate the data based on the key.

How does the $match stage in the aggregation pipeline work?
Answer: The $match stage filters the documents in the pipeline based on a specified condition. It is similar to the find query in MongoDB but can be used within the aggregation pipeline to filter data at an earlier stage of processing.

Code-Related Questions (Moderate):
What does the line db.orders.aggregate([ { $group: { _id: null, totalRevenue: { $sum: { $multiply: ["$quantity", "$price"] } } } } ]) do?
Answer: This aggregation pipeline groups all documents together (since _id is set to null) and calculates the total revenue by multiplying quantity and price for each order and summing the results.

Why do we use { out: "totalQuantities" } in the mapReduce function?
Answer: The { out: "totalQuantities" } specifies that the results of the MapReduce operation will be stored in a new collection called totalQuantities. If it were set to a string value like "inline", the result would be returned directly instead of stored in a collection.

What happens if you run db.orders.createIndex({ "customerName": 1 })?
Answer: This command creates an ascending index on the customerName field. It will speed up queries that search for documents by customerName, improving the performance of operations like find().

What is the role of the reduceFunction in the MapReduce example?
Answer: The reduceFunction takes the emitted key-value pairs from the mapFunction and processes them to aggregate the values. In this case, it sums the quantities for each product.

What is the expected output of the following aggregation pipeline?

js
Copy code
db.orders.aggregate([
    { $match: { "status": "Delivered" } },
    { $sort: { "quantity": -1 } }
])
Answer: This aggregation pipeline filters the orders to only include those with a status of "Delivered", then sorts them in descending order by quantity.

Explain how MongoDB's MapReduce can be different from the aggregation framework in terms of performance.
Answer: The aggregation framework in MongoDB is generally more efficient and easier to use than MapReduce for most operations. MapReduce can be slower because it involves additional stages like emitting and reducing data across multiple map-reduce cycles, whereas the aggregation framework uses a more optimized pipeline approach.

How would you modify the aggregation query to calculate the total revenue only for orders with a status of "Shipped"?
Answer:

js
Copy code
db.orders.aggregate([
    { $match: { "status": "Shipped" } },
    { $group: { _id: null, totalRevenue: { $sum: { $multiply: ["$quantity", "$price"] } } } }
])
Answer Explanation: The query first filters the orders where the status is "Shipped" using $match and then calculates the total revenue using $group.
